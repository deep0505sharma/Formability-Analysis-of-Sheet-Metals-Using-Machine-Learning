# Formability-Analysis-of-Sheet-Metals-Using-Machine-Learning
In sheet metal industries, predicting and avoiding failures, such as necking, fracture, and
wrinkling, is important. Thus, working within a safe region to avoid these failures is important.
The forming limit diagram (FLD) is the most appropriate tool to obtain the safe strain region
for every sheet metal in different conditions. Forming Limit Diagram of perforated sheet metal
can be affected by its mechanical properties like Yield Strength, Sheet thickness, Anisotropy
value, Ultimate Tensile Strength, Strain Hardening exponent, and total elongation. In this
project, the mechanical properties of aluminium and steel metal sheets are correlated with their
forming limit diagram at room temperature. Various models based on machine learning and
deep learning have been introduced to reveal the forming limit diagram of various metal sheets
and then the accuracy of different models was compared to select the best model. The effect of
each mechanical property on the FLD was also studied and analysed. After using experimental
data to train and validate the various models, the models were applied to the test data for the
prediction of forming limit diagrams.
